## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the title field to avoid the conflict between title case and the
  (lowecase) name of a statistic
  
* Changed arXiv references to include their full URL.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.3
* Using devtools::build_win()

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Luca Weihs <lucaw@uw.edu>'
