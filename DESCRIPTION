Description: Computes the t* statistic corresponding to the tau star population
          coefficient introduced by Bergsma and Dassios (Bernoulli 20(2), 2014,
          1006-1028) and does so in  O(n^2*log(n)) time. Also allows for
          independence testing using the asymptotic distribution of t* as described by
          Nandy, Weihs, and Drton (2016).
